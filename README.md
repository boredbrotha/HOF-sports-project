## What do I want to do?

1. I want to successfully be able to scrape the followers of one IG account.
2. After that, I want to fully automate that process, and then output the results into a spreadsheet.
3. For every person on the spreadsheet, I want to be able to see how many followers they share with the rest of the people on it.


## What I should query the data and get 
* Followers
* Unique ones



## Extra stuff I need to do

* Create a function that checks if a sponsored image has been posted



##Things to take note of

* Engagement Rate = sum
