# HOFlib library


## What is HOFlib?

HOFlib is a general auxiliary library that assists in the general operations of HOF Sports.


## Methods
* Default Constructor:
    * HOFlib has two members: athletes(IG handles of the athletes) and headers. You can input these into the default constructor when you initialize the class in your file.

*createDict:
    *createDict creates and returns a dictionary of empty arrays out of the names in ~athletes~. Alternatively, you can have the function create a dictionary from an array you input into the function.

*outputFollowers:
    *This function takes the member, athletes, and fills out athDict with the names of all of each of the athletes' followers.

*export:
    *export exports a DoL into an excel file or csv, depending on what you input into the parameter.

*compareImages:
    *compareImages uses OpenCV to compare one image to another. Contact Asahd about how to use this, it's a little funky but it works if you do it the right way!

*isPostCompleted:
    *isPostCompleted checks through an athlete's IG stories/posts and checks whether they actually did their job.
